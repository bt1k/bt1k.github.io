        <p>PostBoard is a web app using Node.js on the back-end, and Preact on the front-end (which is very similar to React).</p>
        <p>It's a simple website that allows people to leave posts (text messages). A CAPTCHA (provided by hCaptcha) is used as an attempt to prevent bot activity. Also, Google's AI API is used by the back-end as an attempt to prevent offensive posts. When a user submits a post, a request is sent to Google's API asking if the post is offensive. The post is saved if the API says that the post is not offensive.</p>

        <p>This is a basic blog website made with Ruby on Rails. It features the Trix WYSIWYG text editor for writing rich text blog posts. The site features user accounts for different authors of blog posts.</p>
        <p>This website is running on Render, and it has a Postgres database hosted by Neon. Images uploaded to this website are hosted on Cloudinary.</p>

        <p>This is just a simple tech demo at the moment. It's a React Native app, written in TypeScript, with a back-end written in Go.</p>
        <p>It allows you to send messages over a WebSocket to the server. Each message is sent back to the user who sent it. These messages are not saved.</p>
        <p>If the WebSocket disconnects, the front-end will attempt to open a new WebSocket connection every 3 seconds until a new connection succeeds.</p>
