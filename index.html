    <p>Here are some websites I've made:</p>
    <main id="projects">
      <section class="project">
        <h2>New Rails Blog</h2>
        <p class="techTags">
          <span id="ruby">Ruby</span>
          <span id="rails">Rails</span>
        </p>
        <p>This is a basic blog website made with Ruby on Rails. It features the Trix WYSIWYG text editor for writing rich text blog posts. The site features user accounts for different authors of blog posts.</p>
        <p>This website is running on Render, and it has a Postgres database hosted by Neon. Images uploaded to this website are hosted on Cloudinary.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="project">
        <h2>PostBoard</h2>
        <p class="techTags">
          <span id="javascript">JavaScript</span>
          <span id="nodejs">Node.js</span>
          <span id="preact">Preact</span>
        </p>
        <p>PostBoard is a full-stack JavaScript web app. It's a simple website that allows people to leave posts (text messages). A CAPTCHA (provided by hCaptcha) is used as an attempt to prevent bot activity. Also, Google's AI API is used by the back-end as an attempt to prevent offensive posts. When a user submits a post, a request is sent to Google's API asking if the post is offensive. The post is saved if the API says that the post is not offensive.</p>
        <p>The front-end uses the Preact framework (which is very similar to React), while the back-end uses Node.js with the Express framework.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="project">
        <h2>Messenger</h2>
        <p class="techTags">
          <span id="go">Go</span>
          <span id="typescript">TypeScript</span>
          <span id="reactnative">React Native</span>
        </p>
        <p>Messenger is a React Native app, written in TypeScript, with a back-end written in Go.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Messenger's functionality is very basic. It allows the user to send messages to the back-end, and the back-end replies with a very basic response.</p>
        <p>Communication takes place with a WebSocket. If the WebSocket disconnects, the front-end will attempt to open a new WebSocket connection every 3 seconds until a new connection succeeds.</p>
